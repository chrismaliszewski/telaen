Due to some extra functionality in Telaen compared to Uebimiau,
even though old UM themes will still work under Telaen, we
recommend that you update your themes to fold in the new
capability.

For example, since Telaen is now SPAM aware, the 'messagelist.tpl'
template now has access to a Smarty variable 'umHaveSpam'
which prints out whether the user has SPAM (and it has
been moved into their SPAM folder), using the 'have_spam'
contant from the langs/ file selected. There are
also new preferences which should be displayed in
the 'preferences.tpl' template as well. Required
changes will be noted in the CHANGELOG.txt file.

We encourage people to update and revise their old UM
themes for Telaen. We would be happy to bundle them with
the official Telaen releases, assuming compatible
licensing of course.

Thank you for using and supporting Telaen!!
