 	attachments types with dots (like application/vnd.ms-exel) are
 	detected correctly.

 * [New] Little usability issue, error/badlogin pages are merged with
 	login page, the errors are simply displayed in a box.  This also
 	removes unuseful/redudant code. To use this feature, themes need to
 	update their login.htm file (look at default/login.htm for
 	guidance).

 * [New] TinyMce updated to version 2.0.9

 * [New] New feauture: Button for download the entire message


1.1.2:

 	underneath the telaen path.

 * [New] Provide notice that the ./smarty/ directory should be moved
 	someplace outside of the web-space. Done by renaming the directory.

1.1.1:

 * Fixed little bug on catch-address where wrong address was added to
 	addressbook.

1.1.1-rc2:

 * Fixed problem where messages disappear on refresh with zero quota.

 * Little fixes on themes.

1.1.1-rc1:

 * Added sort for personal folders on folders list and fixed a bug can
 	cause duplicate entries in the list.

 * Fixed problem with missing header info when using IMAP. Also
 	addresses possible "double showing" of SPAM email both Inbox and
 	Spam folder.

 * Solved issue when attached images with upcase or capitalized
 	extension (like .JPG or .Gif) are not displayed inline

 * Added check for exclude user address in reply-all

 * Added ability to require a return-receipt on a new message

 * Improved signature/footer attach and multiple quotes on HTML messages

 * umask value and default directory permission bitmask now configurable
 	via the config.php file. Useful for some environs that need a more
 	"open" permission setup. NOTE: this requires people upgrading from
 	1.1.0 or earlier to modify their config.security.php file! Look at
 	the config.security.php.default file for these variable settings.

 * Templates improvements: - now header.htm contains also the <head>
 	section of html - meta tags output in <head> instead of a bad echo
 	- menu.htm template used instead of nav_menu.htm - webmail title
 	configurable in config.php - little restyling on quick address
 	window (mozilla style) - added a different header for popups

 * New check on quick address window, avoid to add an address multiple
 	times.

1.1.0:

 * Updated Smarty to version 2.6.14

 * Added $phpmailer_sendmail and $phpmailer_timeout to
 	config.php.default to allow admin to easily override PHPMailer's
 	default sendmail path and SMTP timeout

 * Changed attachment window size to something large enough to be
 	readable, but not too large.

1.1.0-rc2:

 * Updated TinyMCE to latest rev.

 * Fixed bug on email time calc.

 * Adjusted titles alignment an other little improvements on themes.

1.1.0-rc1:

 * Fix bug where selected messages disappear from list on mark/unmark
 	read functions with 20 or more messages.

 * Fix bug where auto-deleting SPAM could affect other messages in the
 	INBOX.

 * Fix nasty bug where CC addresses were not being delivered if using
 	the 'mail' Mailer (PHPMailer bug).

 * Templates improvement, now we have a page header and footer included
 	in all pages (actually not for login and pop-ups). This allow a
 	faster style personalization.

1.1.0-beta2:

 * Telaen is now aware of the SpamAssassin X-Spam-Level header, and
 	allows users to control auto-SPAM detection sensitivity and SPAM
 	folder autopopulation. For example, a user can specify a
 	sensitivity of 2 (very sensitive), and all messages that have a
 	X-Spam-Level of 2 or more will get auto-moved to the SPAM folder.

 * Bundled themes converted to be xhtml1.0 compliant.

 * Force magic_quotes_runtime to be disabled, since it conflicts with
 	Smarty.

 * Fix issue with message lists when quotas are not used.

 * Provide ways to work around some issues with Redirects. We can now
 	select whether these redirects are performed via HTTP redirects
 	(the Location header) or via META REFRESH and Javascript (see
 	$redirects_use_meta). Also, we can select whether the URLs used for
 	redirects are absolute (as required by HTTP) or relative (see
 	$redirects_are_relative).

 * New feature: mark as read/unread on message list

1.1.0-beta1:

 * Fixed problem with possible incorrect redirects. Instead of checking
 	that $_SERVER['HTTPS'] is non-empty, we check explicitly for it
 	being set to 'on'. The official PHP docs are misleading (wrong)
 	here.

 * Add in extra/check_install.php.txt which performs some simple tests
 	of your installation and setup.

 * No longer require short_open_tag.

 * Some under-the-hood code improvements.

 * Remove the SPAM folder from the list of "folders that stuff can be
 	moved to by the user."

 * The Advanced HTML Editor is now TinyMCE, which is bundled with
 	Telaen. Changes to the newmsg.htm template file may be required
 	(depending on the template) to fully use this.

 * Now, whenever Telaen adds body content (eg: whenever we Decode), we
 	choose to sanitize or not. This means that messages are sanitized
 	when printed or forwarded/replied to. Added a global variable,
 	$sanitize_html to control this ($allow_scripts also works, but is
 	being depreciated since it doesn't reflect what we're really
 	concerned about).

 * Fixed bug where show_body was not using the correct charset (since it
 	was removed by HTMLFilter).

 * Removed old krufty session code to use native PHP session()
 	capability.

 * Removed the tid/lid/sid stuff from the URL. Stored in user sessions,
 	as it should be.

1.0.0:

 * Revised de.txt and pt_BR.txt files.

1.0.0-RC2:

 * Fix the default theme to use a draft Telaen logo instead of the old
 	Uebimiau one.

 * The preferences page is now shown whenever the previously used
 	version and the present version differ by either the Major or Minor
 	version number. For example, moving from 1.0.0 to 1.0.1 will not
 	make it happen, but going from 1.0.4 to 1.1.0 will. This therefore
 	sets the assumption of what the "API" is :)

 * HTML Emails are now filtered through HTMLFilter, to protect against
 	XSS attacks.

 * We no longer get that weird '1' on the upper left of the message list
 	page.

 * Add in a method to adjust for server timezone offsets, if we can't
 	figure out the real offset.

 * Use output buffering within process.php to prevent breakage with
 	redirects.

 * Force exit after all redirects.

 * All redirects are now HTTP/1.1 compliant (ie: the use absolute URLs).

 * Some HTML cleanups for the default theme.

1.0.0-RC1:

 * Fix calculation of timezones.

 * Rename of class files and other notices from Uebimiau to Telaen.

 * Enable marking READ messages as either READ or UNREAD upon logout.
 	The default is UNREAD. This allows users who check their mail with
 	other Email clients to see those messages as "new" and unread.
 	SysAdmin can overrule user prefs by setting:
 	$force_unmark_read_overrule; $force_unmark_read_settingyes; in
 	config.php. Changes: o en_UK.txt: prf_unmark_read_on_exit o
 	preferences.htm

----------------------------------------------------------------
	Uebimiau - the "jimjag" patches:
----------------------------------------------------------------
-------- 2.7.8p3 --------

 * "What is SPAM" regex now definable for
	each UM class.

 * Enable auto-population of the spam folder and add a user pref to
 	auto-delete it at logout time. Spam folder options require the
 	_autospamfolder variable in the Uebimiau class be TRUE. o
 	en_UK.txt: spam_extended prf_empty_spam_on_exit o preferences.htm

 * Make the spam folder a system folder.

 * If using cookies, have the login page explain why a login may not
 	have succeeded due to cookie error (eg: user does not have cookies
 	enabled). Only important if using cookie security. This required
 	changes to the login themes and the lang file. o en_UK.txt
 	:lng_cookie_not_enabled lng_cookie_not_valid o login.htm

 * Store version number in pref's file; since new versions might change
 	or add preferences, this means that UM can now direct the user to
 	their Preferences page as soon as the login after an upgrade
 	(similar to the First Login). Updated preference page theme. o
 	preferences.htm

 * Address book now usable with CC and BCC fields. o newmsg.htm

 * Fold in many improvements submitted by MBR (Martin Blapp) regarding
 	file and folder speedups, detection of ATOP and pipelining support,
 	and spam folders.

-------- 2.7.8p2 --------

 * Change format of session ID to be more file
	system friendly.

 * Folders are now mode 700, for security.

 * No longer depend on the bundled versions of PHPMailer or Smarty,
 	which were kind of old. Instead, force any custom changes to these
 	external projects to be local in scope, allowing us to upgrade them
 	as needed, or to use system-installed versions. (we *do* bundle
 	what we need, for completeness, and to make it a one-shot
 	installation - we just bundle the latest, non-altered versions, but
 	we don't require the version we bundle).

 * Fix some incorrect regex matching, especially when they touch the
 	file system (like allowed folder names).

 * Fix MSIE display errors (usually exhibited as just a blank page)
 	especially with attachments.

 * On login, do the inbox/attachments clean-up. Many people don't bother
 	to logout. :)

 * Auto-clean the server-side inbox and attachments folder to save disk
 	space.

 * Misc code cleanups.
