UPGRADING
---------------

Upgrading should be a painless affair. You can install
the new tarball or zip file right over the old one. Since
we do not bundle the "local" config files, just their
"default" versions (see above, eg: config.php.default),
your old configuration will be saved.

Sometimes, after upgrading, especially if this is the
first time you've installed Telean and have previously
been using Uebimiau, you may be surprised by blank
pages! This is because there is a mismatch between the
pre-compiled Smarty templates and the "new" ones.
To resolve this, delete all the directories in the
temporary folder that start with '%%': These are the
precompiled templates. By removing them, you force
Smarty to re-recompile them again, fixing the blank-page
problem.

If you install the new version overtop the old one, you will also
need to remove the class.*.php files that are left over from the
older version and live in ./inc/ (eg: ./inc/lib.php). In
both cases, the check_install.php script will warn you.

Finally, be SURE that the ./inc/ directory is disabled, ala:

<Location /webmail/inc>
  order allow,deny
  deny from all
</Location>
