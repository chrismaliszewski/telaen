INSTALL
----------------------------------------------------
- Read the README file... really, you should!

- Unpack the package (.tar.gz or .zip file) into temporary directory. 

- Move the 'telaen' folder to where you want it under your
  public webspace.
  eg /home/httpd/webmail (*unix) or c:\inetpub\wwwroot\webmail (Win32).
  
- Make a non web-shared folder (users cannot see this folder throught a web
  browser), eg. /home/telaen or c:\winnt\temp\telaen

- IMPORTANT: If using the bundled Smarty package, move the ./smarty_move_me/
  directory to a non web-shared folder.
 
- The user which the webserver is running (nobody, apache, IUSR_machine,etc)
  need permission to write on this folder. It is best to make
  it owned by the webserver ID and mode 700.

- In the "telaen/inc/config/" directory, copy the following files to their
  new names:
  
     config.languages.php.default  ->  config.languages.php
     config.php.default            ->  config.php
     config.security.php.default   ->  config.security.php
     
- Open all the "inc/config*php" files in a text editor; all instructions are
  commented on this file, pay attention on the $temporary_folder variable and
  the SMARTY_DIR define, set them according your above folder names.

- Check your installation setup by performing the following
  tasks:
      o Rename extra/check_install.php.txt to extra/check_install.php
      o Access check_install.php via your browser, eg:
             http://jimjag.github.io/telaen/telaen/extra/check_install.php
      o Make any required changes.
      o Be SURE to REMOVE check_install.php or RENAME it back to
        check_install.php.txt !!!

- If not using the bundled version of Smarty, be sure to copy the
  function.um_welcome_message.php.txt in the 'patches'
  directory file to your Smarty plugins folder (rename it to
  function.um_welcome_message.php)!

- Ensure that the ./inc/ directory cannot be accessed directly.
  There are many ways to do this, but the easiest is using
  ACLs:
    <Location /webmail/inc>  # or whatever
      order allow,deny
      deny from all
    </Location>

PERFORMANCE
---------------

The performance of Telaen, of course, depends on the speed of
your Webserver, PHP and your POP3/IMAP Email server. Even so,
here are some helpful hints:

  a. Use Apache 2.2.
  b. Just for Telaen, configure PHP with a large memory
     allocation and a long (or non-existant) time-limit.
  c. Use a good PHP cache, like XCache or APC.
  d. If possible, host your Email server on your Web server,
     so you can connect to the loopback address.
  e. IMAP itself is a faster interface, so use that if you can.
  f. If using POP3, there are some additional hints:
     1. Encourage people to use Folders and to keep their
        Inbox as small as possible.
     2. Remove any SPAM as quickly as possible.
  g. Enabling quotas involves some overhead which you
     may wish to avoid.
