<h2>
<a name="overview" class="anchor" href="#overview"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Overview</h2>

<p>Telaen is a web-based e-mail client written in PHP. What is particularly
nice about Telaen is that it is fast, lean and simple, but also extremely
powerful. It does not require much more than a "standard" PHP
installation, nor does it require an external database. It supports multiple
folders, POP3 and IMAP, is SPAM aware and incorporates WYSIWYG editors
for Email composition. It supports multiple languages as well as
multiple themes (or "skins").</p>

<p>Telaen 1.3.x is compatible with PHP4 and PHP5. Starting with Telaen
2.x, support for PHP4 will be dropped.</p>

<p>Telaen was originally based on Uebimiau.</p>

<p>We recommend that you read the other documents in the docs/ subdirectory,
especially the CHANGELOG.txt and INSTALL.txt files.</p>

<h2>
<a name="design-philosophy" class="anchor" href="#design-philosophy"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Design Philosophy</h2>
<p>First of all, Telaen is designed and architectured to be as small
and as compact as possible; some may even say Telaen is "minimalistic".
The reason is that as projects get larger and more complex, they are
more difficult to update, to vet and review, and to keep secure.
Simplicity, after all, is a virtue.</p>

<p>The other basic philosophy is to leverage PHP and existing 3rd
party libraries as much as possible, but without making the level
of dependencies onerous for the sys-admin. There's no need to
re-create the wheel, unless we can do it faster, or easier.</p>

<p>Finally, as ex-sys-admins ourselves, as well as developers,
Telaen is designed to be plug-and-play. Plugins are a great
idea, and maybe Telaen will support them in the future, but
requiring sys-admins to find, install, config and debug Plugins
to add basic features that should be core to a webapp, doesn't
make sense to us.</p>

<h2>
<a name="why-you-might-need-it" class="anchor" href="#why-you-might-need-it"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why you might need it</h2>

<p>Other PHP-based webmails require external database support as well as a long
laundry-list of other PHP libs and extensions; not Telaen. If
you need an powerful yet simple and clean webmail system, Telaen will likely fit the bill.</p>

<p>And, if you are stuck running ancient Uebimiau, you should
really move to Telaen asap.</p>
